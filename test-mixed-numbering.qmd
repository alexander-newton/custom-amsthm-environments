# First Section

This document tests continuous numbering across BOTH custom environments AND Quarto's built-in types.

::: {#thm-builtin1}
## Built-in Theorem
This is Quarto's built-in theorem. Should be 1.1.
:::

::: {#prm-custom1}
Custom Problem environment. Should be 1.2 (continuing from theorem).
:::

::: {#def-builtin1}
Built-in Definition. Should be 1.3 (continuing the sequence).
:::

::: {#clm-custom1}
## Important Claim
Custom Claim environment. Should be 1.4 (still continuing).
:::

::: {#lem-builtin1}
Built-in Lemma. Should be 1.5.
:::

The goal is: Theorem 1.1, Problem 1.2, Definition 1.3, Claim 1.4, Lemma 1.5 - all sharing the same counter!
