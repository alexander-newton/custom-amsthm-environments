title: "Chapter 2: Basic Examples"
---

The default numbering style is `section`, which numbers environments within sections.

## First Section

::: {#prm-chapter2-first}
This is the first problem in Chapter 2, Section 1.
:::

::: {#prm-chapter2-second}
## Titled Problem

This is the second problem with a title.
:::

We can reference @prm-chapter2-first and @prm-chapter2-second.

## Second Section

::: {#prm-chapter2-third}
This problem should be numbered as 3.3 in PDF.
:::

See @prm-chapter2-third for details.

## Global Numbering Example

Tasks use global numbering:

::: {#tsk-chapter2-first}
Complete this task.
:::

::: {#tsk-chapter2-second}
## Advanced Task

This builds on @tsk-chapter2-first.
:::

Note that tasks (@tsk-chapter2-first and @tsk-chapter2-second) are numbered globally, not by section.

::: {#thm-in-chapter2}
## Theorem in chapter 2

If this, then that.
