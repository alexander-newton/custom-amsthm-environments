title: "Chapter 3: Cross-References Across Chapters"
---

This chapter tests cross-references to environments defined in other chapters.

## References to Previous Chapter

We can reference problems from Chapter 2:

- @prm-chapter2-first from Chapter 2
- @prm-chapter2-third from Chapter 2, Section 2

And tasks:

- @tsk-chapter2-first 
- @tsk-chapter2-second

## New Problems in This Chapter

::: {#prm-chapter3-first}
## Chapter 3 Problem

This is the first problem in Chapter 3.
:::

::: {#tsk-chapter3-final}
Try rendering the entire book and verify all cross-references work.
:::

Final check: @prm-chapter3-first and @tsk-chapter3-final should be properly numbered.

## Integration with Built-in Environments

The custom environments coexist with Quarto's built-in theorem environments:

::: {#thm-builtin}
## Built-in Theorem

This uses Quarto's standard theorem environment.
:::

Compare @thm-builtin (built-in) and @thm-in-chapter2 (bult-in, defined in a different chapter) with @prm-chapter3-first (custom).
