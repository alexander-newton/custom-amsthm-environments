# First Section

## Standard Numbering

::: {#axm-first}
Standard axiom. Should be 1.1.
:::

::: {#prm-first}
Standard problem. Should be 1.2.
:::

## Override with Custom Number

::: {#axm-special number="A1"}
## Axiom of Certainty
This axiom uses override number "A1" instead of sequential numbering.
:::

::: {#prm-after}
This problem should be 1.3 (sequential numbering continues separately).
:::

::: {#axm-another number="A2"}
Another special axiom with custom number A2.
:::

## Override with Custom Name (No Number)

::: {#axm-named number="Axiom of Choice"}
This uses a custom name instead of a number.
:::

Expected output:
- Axiom 1.1 (standard)
- Problem 1.2 (standard)
- Axiom A1 (Axiom of Certainty) - override
- Problem 1.3 (continues sequential)
- Axiom A2 - override
- Axiom of Choice - override with name
