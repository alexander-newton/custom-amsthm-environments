# Regression Test

This test verifies that custom theorem types with spaces in their display names
render correctly to PDF. Previously, auto-generated LaTeX environment names
would include spaces (e.g., "my theorem with spaces"), which is invalid LaTeX
syntax and caused the compilation to hang.

The fix ensures that auto-generated latex_name values have spaces removed.

::: {#mythm-first}
This theorem type has "My Theorem With Spaces" as its display name.
The auto-generated latex name should be "mytheoremwithspaces".
:::

::: {#mylem-second}
This lemma has "Another Name With Spaces" as its display name.
:::

::: {#mydef-third}
This definition has "Yet Another Spaced Name" as its display name.
:::

All three environments should render successfully without hanging during LaTeX compilation.
