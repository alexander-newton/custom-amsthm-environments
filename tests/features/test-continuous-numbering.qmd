# Introduction

This document demonstrates continuous numbering across different theorem-like environments.

# First Section

## Theorems

::: {#mythm-first}
## First Theorem
This should be Theorem 2.1.
:::

::: {#myexm-first}
This should be Example 2.2 (continuing from Theorem 2.1).
:::

::: {#mycor-first}
## Important Corollary
This should be Corollary 2.3 (continuing the sequence).
:::

::: {#myaxm-first}
This should be Axiom 2.4 (still continuing).
:::

# Second Section

::: {#mythm-second}
This should be Theorem 3.1 (new section, counter resets).
:::

::: {#myexm-second}
## Another Example
This should be Example 3.2.
:::

::: {#mycor-second}
This should be Corollary 3.3.
:::

Notice how all different environment types (Theorem, Example, Corollary, Axiom) share the same counter within each section!
