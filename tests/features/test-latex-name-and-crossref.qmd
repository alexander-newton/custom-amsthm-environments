# Testing LaTeX Name Auto-Generation

This test verifies two critical fixes:

1. **Auto-generated latex-name uses key, not name**: When no explicit `latex-name` is provided, the filter should use the `key` value instead of auto-generating from the `name`. This prevents conflicts with Quarto's built-in theorem types.

2. **Cross-references resolve in LaTeX**: The `@mydef-first` syntax should be converted to proper LaTeX `\hyperref` commands in PDF output.

## Test Definitions

::: {#mydef-first}

##### First Definition

This is the first definition. The LaTeX environment should be `mydef`, not `definition`.

:::

::: {#mythm-main}

##### Main Theorem

This is the main theorem. The LaTeX environment should be `mythm`, not `theorem`.

:::

::: {#customaxm-basic}

##### Basic Axiom

This uses explicit latex-name. The LaTeX environment should be `customaxiom`.

:::

## Test Cross-References

Here we reference the definitions and theorems:

- Reference to @mydef-first should work
- Reference to @mythm-main should work
- Reference to @customaxm-basic should work

According to @mydef-first, we can see that the environment is correct. Furthermore, @mythm-main shows that the theorem numbering works. Finally, @customaxm-basic demonstrates explicit latex-name specification.
