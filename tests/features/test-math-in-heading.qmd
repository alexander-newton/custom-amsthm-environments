# Math in Headings

## Basic math in heading

::: {#mythm-mathbasic}

##### A result about $x^2$

This theorem has basic inline math in its heading.

:::

## Fraction in heading

::: {#mydef-mathfrac}

##### The $\frac{a}{b}$ identity

This definition has a fraction in its heading.

:::

## Subscript and superscript

::: {#mythm-mathsub}

##### Properties of $a_n$ and $b^k$

This theorem has subscripts and superscripts in the heading.

:::

## No math in heading (control)

::: {#mythm-nomath}

##### A Simple Result

This theorem has no math in its heading and should work fine.
